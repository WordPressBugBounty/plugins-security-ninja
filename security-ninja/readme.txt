== Changelog ==

= 5.267 =
* 2026-02-13
* IMPROVED: Litespeed servers - Added documentation and in-app notices for all security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy). LiteSpeed users can add headers directly to .htaccess using the examples in each test description. Thank you Tom for the feedback.
* FIX: Events Logger, Overview, and Visitor Log – Country flags now correctly show the event/visitor IP's country instead of the logged-in admin's IP when the site is behind Cloudflare or similar proxies.
* Improved: Core Scanner - Interface loads faster with tabs lazy-loading content in different tabs.
* IMPROVED: Firewall – When "Block IP Network" is enabled, known social and link-preview crawlers (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) are no longer blocked by default. Link previews when you share your site on social networks now work without having to whitelist IPs.

= 5.266 =
* 2026-02-10
* Improvement: Logging details for 404 Guard.
* FIX: Login Protection – Banned IPs expired entries are removed immediately instead of waiting for the prune job.
* IMPROVED: Login Protection – Prune job for banned IPs now runs hourly.
* FIX: Cloud Firewall IP Management – "Locally Banned IPs" list now shows only currently banned IPs (expired bans are excluded).

* Updated language file for translations.

= 5.265 =

= 5.264 =
* 2026-01-31
* FIX: Fixed wpdb::prepare() error during plugin uninstallation when dropping database tables.
* FIX: Vulnerability scanner no longer blocks wp-admin after deactivating and reactivating the plugin. If the vulnerability data files are missing or unreadable (e.g. after reactivation or server changes), the plugin now recovers automatically: it shows the vulnerability count as zero until the data is restored in the background, and the dashboard continues to load normally.
* IMPROVED: Vulnerability module now recreates and re-downloads its data files when they are missing, so you no longer need to reinstall the plugin to fix a "JSONL file not readable" error.
* FIX: Hardened vulnerability JSONL file handling: guard fclose() on stream and catch all errors when counting records, so missing or unreadable files never cause a fatal in wp-admin.
* FIX: Login Protection - "Failed login warnings" toggle now correctly saves when disabled (was reverting to enabled because unchecked checkbox is omitted from form POST).
* FIX: 2FA – Disabling 2FA in settings now persists correctly; toggle uses a hidden input so unchecked state is saved.

* Improved bandwidth usage getting vulnerabilities for all users.
* Improved: Vulnerability scanner now reads vulnerability feeds in a streaming, memory-efficient way to reduce peak memory usage.

= 5.260 =
* 2025-11-12
* NEW: Failed login email warnings - administrators receive email notifications when someone attempts to log in with their username and fails. Can be enabled in Login Form Protection settings.
* NEW: Admin IPs are automatically whitelisted on plugin activation and successful admin login to prevent administrators from being blocked. Thank you Val.
* FIX: Fixed country blocking to respect "only block backend" setting when enabled. Thank you Guru for the tip.
* IMPROVED: Secret access URL processing has been moved up in the request cycle to make sure IP whitelisting happens before any ban checks, so blocked visitors should be able to get back on the site more reliably.
* IMPROVED: wp-config.php backups are stored in encrypted format (AES-256-CBC) to ensure data security. Each backup uses a unique encryption key and initialization vector. This was introduced in a previous release, but was not added to the changelog.
* Update 3rd party libraries - Freemius SDK 2.13.0 among others.
