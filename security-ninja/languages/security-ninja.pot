"Usernames (unlike passwords) are not secret. By knowing someone's username, "
"you can't login to their account. You need the password too. However, by "
"knowing the username, you are one step closer to logging in, using the "
"username to brute-force the password or to gain access in some similar way. "
"That's why it's advisable to keep the list of usernames a secret. At least "
"to some degree. By default, by accessing siteurl.com/?author={id} and "
"looping through IDs from 1 you can get a list of usernames because WP will "
"redirect you to siteurl.com/author/username/ if the ID exists in the system."
